"In this dialog window you can define the name of a gateway to the real world "
"(i.e. the world of the host machine) and set many parameters for it:\n"
"\n"
"- Label: a string appearing near the router icon in the network graph; this "
"field is exclusively for graphic purposes, is not taken in consideration for "
"the configuration.\n"
"\n"
"- Ipv4 address: the address of the gateway that will be used by the virtual "
"machines connected to it.\n"
"\n"
"- DHCP service: enabling this option, machines will be able to use the world "
"gateway as DHCP server, receiving leases in the range defined by the Ipv4 "
"address. This service also provides a DNS proxy\n"
"\n"
"- Integrated switch ports: the number of ports of the integrated switch "
"(default 4); this number must not be increased without a good reason, "
"because the number of processes needed for the device emulation is "
"proportional to its ports number.\n"
