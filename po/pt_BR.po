" To create a bridge on your (real) host using the same network as eth0 (by "
"example) you need to : 1) create a bridge with the name define in marionnet."
"conf by MARIONNET_BRIDGE, 2) put and configure eth0 (on your real host) in "
"the bridge and 3) put an IP address on the bridge (with dhclient or ifconfig/"
"route).\n"
"\n"
"In such a case, after having start the virtual network in marionnet you can "
"configure an ethernet card of a virtual machines which is connect to the "
"Ethernet socket (or on the same network) in order to give access to your "
"local network to it.\n"
"\n"
" The socket also allows team-work in a network laboratory, by creating a "
"connection between Marionnet instances running on different machines. For "
"more information about bridge et Ethernet socket configuration, please see "
"the Marionnet Wiki on the marionnet.org website."

"In this dialog window you can define the name of a gateway to the real world "
"(i.e. the world of the host machine) and set many parameters for it:\n"
"\n"
"- Label: a string appearing near the router icon in the network graph; this "
"field is exclusively for graphic purposes, is not taken in consideration for "
"the configuration.\n"
"\n"
"- Ipv4 address: the address of the gateway that will be used by the virtual "

"\n"
"- DHCP service: enabling this option, machines will be able to use the world "
"gateway as DHCP server, receiving leases in the range defined by the Ipv4 "
"address. This service also provides a DNS proxy\n"
"\n"
"- Integrated switch ports: the number of ports of the integrated switch "
