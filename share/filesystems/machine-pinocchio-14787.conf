# Supported kernel(s) with their console-related parameters (according to the
# content of /etc/inittab). The variable SUPPORTED_KERNELS may contain a list
# of statements of the form:
#
#   KERNEL [PARAMS]  [KERNEL [PARAMS]]..
#
# where
#
#   KERNEL ::= "[" EPITHET "]"
#            | "/" REGEXP  "/"
#
#   PARAMS is a string
#   EPITHET
#     is the suffix (the substring after "linux-") of an available 
#     kernel in a "kernels/" directory
#   REGEXP is a regular expression (possibly denoting some epithets)
#
# Several statements KERNEL [PARAMS] may be specified. Note that if you are
# using the += assignment operator to catenate statements, please dont forget
# the blank character to separe words (example: SUPPORTED_KERNELS+=" ...").
# 
# Examples:
# SUPPORTED_KERNELS='[2.6.18-ghost] con=none ssl=xterm console=ttyS0'
# SUPPORTED_KERNELS+=' /3[.]0[.].*/ con=none con0=xterm ssl=xterm'
#
SUPPORTED_KERNELS='[2.6.18-ghost] con=none ssl=xterm console=ttyS0'

# X11 compliance. The possible (multiple) choices are "xhosted" and "xnested".
# The value "none" is equivalent to leave this variable empty, which means
# that the filesystem doesn't have the support to display X programs.
#
# Examples:
# X11_SUPPORT+="xhosted"
# X11_SUPPORT+="xnested"
# X11_SUPPORT="none"
#
X11_SUPPORT="none"
