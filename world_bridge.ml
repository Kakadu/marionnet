In this dialog window you can define the name of an Ethernet socket \
and set parameters for it. This component allows to connect the virtual \
network to a Linux bridge whose name is defined by the user via the \
configuration variable called MARIONNET_BRIDGE (in marionnet.conf or provide on \
the command line).\n\n\
If the bridge is correctly set on the host (before starting the network), virtual \
machines will be able to access to the same network services (DHCP, DNS, NFS, \
...) that the host can access on its local network; if the host is on the Internet \
then also the virtual machines linked to the socket will be.\n \n \
To create a bridge on your (real) host using the same network as eth0 (by \
example) you need to : 1) create a bridge with the name define in marionnet.conf \
by MARIONNET_BRIDGE, 2) put and configure eth0 (on your real host) in the \
bridge and 3) put an IP address on the bridge (with dhclient or ifconfig/route).\n\n\
In such a case, after having start the virtual network in marionnet you can \
configure an ethernet card of a virtual machines which is connect to the \
Ethernet socket (or on the same network) in order to give access to your \
local network to it.\n\n \
The socket also allows team-work in a network laboratory, by creating a \
connection between Marionnet instances running on different machines. \
For more information about bridge et Ethernet socket configuration, please \
see the Marionnet Wiki on the marionnet.org website.")
